    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age,age2); //100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age,age2);  //200 100

    let name = 'Wes'
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name,name2); //Wes Wes
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); //Wesley Wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players,team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[5] = 'Lux'; //this will update both the original and copy
    console.log(players,team); //arrays are not the same as strings and numbers

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        // now here is the problem!
        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!



    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //slice will take a copy of the entire array 
    team2[5] = 'Kaia'; //only will update in team2


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; //spread into team4

    const team5 = Array.from(players); //makes a copy 
    

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; //makes a reference
    captain.number = 99; 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:100}); //makes a copy

    //very shallow, only one level deep
